                    href="http://cse-gsa.eng.ucsd.edu/grad-student-lounge/chezbob/history">the
                    archives here</a> (courtesy of Robert Bowdidge, Bob Carragher,

                <h4>circa 1988</h4>
                <p class="longtext">The *CCCP* (*C* offee and *C* andy *C* o-o *P*) was formed by
                Sue Merritt and Jim Mattson. Roughly 6 different brands of soda, 6
                different types of candy bars, and coffee (all from Costco) were
                orignially stocked. Weekly resupply trips were made with Sue's
                Toyota Corolla as the vehicle of choice. At this point, the grad
                lounge didn't even exist! The co-op operated in 3218, then the
                department library, using a makeshift lockbox epoxied to a
                table.</p>

                <h4>1990?</h4>
                <p class="longtext">After a brief period during which it was unclear who ran the
                co-op, Robert Bowdidge and Bob Carragher took on the responsibility
                of the co-op, vowing to breathe life back into the empty co-op.
                Shortly thereafter, Eric Anderson joined the pair to ensure the
                co-op's survival. The new vehicle of choice: a 1978 Chevy Impala.
                With the new leadership came a new name: <span style="font-style: italic;">Chez Bob</span>.</p>
