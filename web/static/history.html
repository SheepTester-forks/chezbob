                    "CCCP was going in 1974/5 when I used to
                collect money from a Coke Machine that we had in AP&#38;M 4301,
                which then was a faculty / student / staff lounge. We furnished
                coffee and cookies, etc. from the Price Club, and each week a
                man came to fill up the coke machine with different types of
                sodas; we could then buy a coke from the machine for 10
                cents.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Since I collected all the money and was robbed 2 or 3 times we
                decided to get a checking account.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Two former students and myself had a checkbook and the names
                of the two grads and myself were on the checks. We would
                deposit the money, <span class="italian">ALL DIMES</span>,
                mostly, and pay expenses from the checks.</p>

                <br />
                <p>This went on for many years under the name of the Applied
                Physics and Information Science Department (APIS), later
                changed to Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS),
                and, after a few years Sue Merritt finally took over the check
                book ... (never did find out what she did with the money but
                guess she saved it to go to Africa this year)."</p>

                Sue Merritt and Jim Mattson. Roughly 6 different brands of soda, 6
                different types of candy bars, and coffee (all from <span
                                                                            class="strike">Price
                                                                            Club</span> Costco) were
                orignially stocked. Weekly resupply trips were made with Sue's
                Toyota Corolla as the vehicle of choice. At this point, the grad
                lounge didn't even exist! The co-op operated in 3218, then the
                department library, using <a

                    makeshift lockbox epoxied to a table</a>.</p>

                <h4>1990 (?)</h4>
                <p>After a brief period during which it was unclear who ran the
                co-op, Robert Bowdidge and Bob Carragher took on the responsibility
                of the co-op, vowing to breathe life back into the empty co-op.
                Shortly thereafter, Eric Anderson joined the pair to ensure the
                co-op's survival. The new vehicle of choice: a 1978 Chevy Impala.
                With the new leadership came <a

                <p>The allocation of the current grad student lounge, in
                combination with the enthusiasm of the new management ensuring
                an uninterrupted flow of empty calories into department
                members' happy stomachs. Everyone rejoiced. Yay!</p>

                <h4>1991&#8211;1995</h4>
                <p>Under the watchful eye of Bob Carragher and Eric Anderson, Chez
                Bob became a fixture of the CSE Department. During this period,
                the folks who ran Chez Bob discovered that Costco would deliver
                shipments of sufficiently large size. The selection of goods
                steadily expanded to include more snacks, more drinks, and
                frozen foods, and spending topped $1,000 each month. A recent
                excavation effort yielded <a
                    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chezbob/chezbob-legacy/master/www/images/old_door.jpg">a piece of a vintage Chez Bob
                    cabinet</a>, which our
                advanced artifact dating techniques have shown probably
                originated from this era.</p>

                <h4>1995&#8211;1997</h4>
                <p>Darren Atkinson, Jeremy Sussman, and Chris Vogt all had a

                <h4>Summer 1998</h4>
                <p>Alan Su began running Chez Bob.</p>

                <h4>March 26, 1999</h4>
                <p>On this date, the first version of <span

                linux machine. The initial version of the software was a single
                Perl script making calls to the <span

                stored in a PostgreSQL database. Thanks to CSEHelp (for the
                machine) and the UCSD GSA (for the monitor).</p>

                <h4>September 21, 1999</h4>
                <p>Having more or less successfully weaned the department's
                current users of the system from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chezbob/chezbob-legacy/master/www/images/cards.jpg">the legacy "index card"
                    accounting system</a>,
                all Chez Bob users were now proud owners of B.o.B. 2K accounts.
                Students, staff, and faculty who joined the department after
                this date have never had the joy of tracking their co-op
                balance on cute little colored index cards.</p>

                <h4>September 2000</h4>
                <!-- TODO: mention that this is probably no longer the current
                     configuration -->
                <p>Sadly, the initial chezbob.ucsd.edu machine became unstable,
                due to a combination of a failing disk and bad memory. So,
                chezbob.ucsd.edu was "upgraded" to a Pentium 90 MHz linux
                machine with 64 MB of memory. As of 9/1/2002, this is the
                current configuration.</p>

                <h4>Spring 2001</h4>
                <p>An intrepid CSE 210 (Software Engineering) group consisting
                of Michael Copenhafer, Wesley Leong, Seth Delackner, Cuong
                Pham, and Yunfeng Fei decided that the existing Chez Bob
                interface, in concept and implementation, lacked purity.
                Together with the Chez Bob management and Prof. Bill Griswold,
                this group of students set out to change the face of Chez Bob.
                Aside from greatly improving the readability and
                maintainability of the code, a barcode reader was added to the
                system, and a sound card and speech synthesizer was included to
                give Chez Bob a voice (
                <audio controls
                       src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chezbob/chezbob-legacy/master/www/bob.wav"></audio>).
                Finally, an innovative <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010701003109/http://chezbob.ucsd.edu/">web interface</a> was
                added. This system was dubbed <span class="italian">B.o.B.
                    2001</span>.</p>

                <br /><br />
                <p>Concurrent with the new B.o.B. 2001 system, the job of
                running Chez Bob was formally split into several roles and
                incorporated into the <a
                                              href="http://cse-gsa.eng.ucsd.edu/">CSE-GSA</a>. With the help of the CSE-GSA,
                Chez Bob should continue to flourish and provide the department
                with research-inducing food and beverage.</p>

                <h4>Summer 2005</h4>
                <p>The first code change in four years added ability to buy
                espresso from Bob. Thanks to... whom?</p>
