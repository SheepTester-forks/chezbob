              Coke Machine that we had in AP&#38;M 4301, which then was a
              faculty / student / staff lounge. We furnished coffee and cookies,
              etc. from the Price Club, and each week a man came to fill up the
              coke machine with different types of sodas; we could then buy a
              coke from the machine for 10 cents.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              Since I collected all the money and was robbed 2 or 3 times we
              decided to get a checking account.

            <br />
            <p>
              Two former students and myself had a checkbook and the names of
              the two grads and myself were on the checks. We would deposit the
              money, <span class="italian">ALL DIMES</span>, mostly, and pay
              expenses from the checks.

            <p>
              This went on for many years under the name of the Applied Physics
              and Information Science Department (APIS), later changed to
              Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS), and, after a
              few years Sue Merritt finally took over the check book ... (never
              did find out what she did with the money but guess she saved it to
              go to Africa this year)."

              bars, and coffee (all from
              <span class="strike">Price Club</span> Costco) were orignially
              stocked. Weekly resupply trips were made with Sue's Toyota Corolla
              as the vehicle of choice. At this point, the grad lounge didn't
              even exist! The co-op operated in 3218, then the department

              After a brief period during which it was unclear who ran the
              co-op, Robert Bowdidge and Bob Carragher took on the
              responsibility of the co-op, vowing to breathe life back into the
              empty co-op. Shortly thereafter, Eric Anderson joined the pair to
              ensure the co-op's survival. The new vehicle of choice: a 1978
              Chevy Impala. With the new leadership came

            <p>
              Under the watchful eye of Bob Carragher and Eric Anderson, Chez
              Bob became a fixture of the CSE Department. During this period,
              the folks who ran Chez Bob discovered that Costco would deliver
              shipments of sufficiently large size. The selection of goods
              steadily expanded to include more snacks, more drinks, and frozen
              foods, and spending topped $1,000 each month. A recent excavation
              effort yielded

              On this date, the first version of
              <span class="italian">B.o.B. 2k</span> (Bank of Bob 2000) was
              deployed in the grad lounge, using an AMD K6 233MHz linux machine.
              The initial version of the software was a single Perl script
              making calls to the <span class="italian">dialog</span>(1) command
              line utility for creating user interfaces. Balance information is

            <p>
              Sadly, the initial chezbob.ucsd.edu machine became unstable, due
              to a combination of a failing disk and bad memory. So,
              chezbob.ucsd.edu was "upgraded" to a Pentium 90 MHz linux machine
              with 64 MB of memory. As of 9/1/2002, this is the current
              configuration.

            <h4>Spring 2001</h4>
            <p>
              An intrepid CSE 210 (Software Engineering) group consisting of
              Michael Copenhafer, Wesley Leong, Seth Delackner, Cuong Pham, and
              Yunfeng Fei decided that the existing Chez Bob interface, in
              concept and implementation, lacked purity. Together with the Chez
              Bob management and Prof. Bill Griswold, this group of students set
              out to change the face of Chez Bob. Aside from greatly improving
              the readability and maintainability of the code, a barcode reader
              was added to the system, and a sound card and speech synthesizer
              was included to give Chez Bob a voice (
              <audio
                controls

              ></audio

              <a
                href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010701003109/http://chezbob.ucsd.edu/"
                >web interface</a
              >
              was added. This system was dubbed
              <span class="italian">B.o.B. 2001</span>.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              Concurrent with the new B.o.B. 2001 system, the job of running
              Chez Bob was formally split into several roles and incorporated
              into the <a href="http://cse-gsa.eng.ucsd.edu/">CSE-GSA</a>. With
              the help of the CSE-GSA, Chez Bob should continue to flourish and
              provide the department with research-inducing food and beverage.
