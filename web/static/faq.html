            <h2>General</h2>

                <h3>What is Chez Bob?</h3>
                <p>Chez Bob (pronounced 'SHAY bob', or if you're a word nerd, /ʃeɪ bɑb/) is a 24/7, fully student- and volunteer-run snack and coffee co-op. We purchase snacks from Costco and sell them to graduate students, faculty, and staff. Chez Bob works like a bank. Users have accounts with balances. You pay by scanning what you take, which deducts from your balance. You can make deposits with cash at the kiosk.</p>

            <h2>Money</h2>

                <h3>Who pays for Chez Bob?</h3>
                <p>Chez Bob funds itself, and does not receive any payment or funding from the CSE department. Costco orders are paid for with the money made from selling snacks and drinks. This means that it's very important to pay your debts and refrain from stealing, since that leaves Chez Bob with less money to order more snacks and drinks.</p>

            <h2>Snacks</h2>

                <h3>Can you stock this &lt;snack/drink/other item&gt;?</h3>

                <h3>Can you stock this &lt;snack/drink/other item&gt; that Costco Business does not carry?</h3>
                
                <h3>Why don't you stock any "healthy" items?</h3>
                <p>We have tried in the past to stack "healthy" items like fruits, vegetables, yogurts, etc., but often these items did not sell quickly enough
