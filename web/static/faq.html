                <h3>What is Chez Bob?</h3>
                <p>Chez Bob (pronounced 'SHAY bob', or if you're a word nerd, /ÊƒeÉª bÉ‘b/) is a 24/7, fully student- and volunteer-run snack and coffee co-op. We purchase snacks from Costco and sell them to graduate students, faculty, and staff. Chez Bob works like a bank. Users have accounts with balances. You pay by scanning what you take, which deducts from your balance. You can make deposits with cash at the kiosk.</p>
           
                <h3>What does Chez Bob offer?</h3>
                <p>Chez Bob sells the following items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Snacks (ramen, oatmeal, jerky, chips, cookies, candy, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Drinks (sparkling water, soda, iced tea/coffee, energy drinks, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Espresso (<a href="#espresso">you need to be trained before you can use it</a>)</li>
                    <li>Cold brew</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to the food and drink that's for sale, there are also lots of free things in the Chez Bob room that students can take advantage of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pool table</li>
                    <li>Foosball table</li>
                    <li>Arcade cabinet (retro games, WiiU, and a dock for a Switch)</li>
                    <li>Workspaces with tabletop outlets</li>
                    <li>Board games (to borrow)</li>
                </ul>
                 
                <h3 id="espresso">How does the espresso machine work?</h3>
                <p>In order to use the espresso machine, you first need to be trained to ensure you know how to operate it properly. For the current training times, please reach out to whoever is listed as the "Espresso Executive" on the <a href="./team.html">team page</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>I heard there was free food ðŸ‘€?</h3>
                <p>People often leave any leftover food from events on the counter in Chez Bob, so check the #chezbob channel in the CSE Slack for any free food announcements! If you're not part of the CSE slack, please email <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a> to be added.</p>

                <h3>Where can I report a bug/issue/mess/leak?</h3>
                <p>Please either send a message in the #chezbob channel in the CSE Slack, or send us an email at <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="accounts">Accounts</h2>
            
                <h3 id="eligibility">Who can get a Chez Bob account?</h3>
                <p>The following CSE members are eligible for Chez Bob accounts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>CSE Graduate Students</li>
                    <li>Postdocs and Visiting Scholars</li>
                    <li>Faculty</li>
                    <li>Staff</li>
                    <li>Students doing research with CSE professors</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Overall, in order to get a Chez Bob account you need to have a CSE professor who can take responsibility for you, so we have someone to contact should any issues arise (e.g. excessive debt, stealing, otherwise misusing Chez Bob). This means that in general, undergraduate students are not eligible for Chez Bob accounts. The only exceptions to this are undergraduates doing research with a CSE professor, or undergraduates tutoring/TAing for a CSE professor. In those cases, you will only have access to Chez Bob while you still hold that position (i.e. if you only tutor for one quarter, your Chez Bob access would end at the end of that quarter).</p>

                <h3 id="new-acct">How do I get a Chez Bob account?</h3>
                <p>First, <a href="#eligibility">make sure you are eligible</a> for a Chez Bob account. Second, <a href="#existing-acct">make sure you don't already have a Chez Bob account</a>-- we automatically create new accounts for incoming grad students, faculty, and staff every fall. If you are eligible for an account and don't already have one, then please email <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a> with your name, UCSD email, and CSE affiliation (grad student, faculty, etc). If you are an undergraduate, please also CC the advisor who can "vouch" for you (your research advisor or the professor for the class you tutor).</p>

                <h3 id="existing-acct">How do I check if I already have a Chez Bob account?</h3> 
                <p>Go into Chez Bob (CSE 3154) and click the "Manual Login" button. Try using the first half of your UCSD email (e.g. 'chezbob' if your UCSD email is 'chezbob@ucsd.edu') and a blank password to log in. If that works, congrats! You have an existing Chez Bob account. If not, please <a href="#new-acct">request an account</a>.</p>

                <h3>How do I add an NFC login card?</h3>
                <p>First, log into your account on the kiosk. Then click the "Account Management" button, and from there, the "Add NFC login card" button. You will then be asked to tap your NFC login card (UCSD ID, AirTag, etc.) on the NFC reader.</p>

                <h3 id="set-pw">How do I set/change the password on my account?</h3>
                <p>First, log into your account on the kiosk. Then click the "Account Management" button, and then the "Change Password" button. From there you should be able to enter your old and new password.</p>

                <h3>How do I reset my password? I forgot :(</h3>
                <p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a> and we can reset your password.</p> 

            <h2 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h2>
                
                <h3>How can I help out with Chez Bob?</h3>
                <p>Glad you asked! Since Chez Bob is entirely volunteer-run, there are lots of ways to help, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Restocking snacks and drinks every week</li>
                    <li>Unloading and storing our (roughly) monthly Costco orders</li>
                    <li>Cleaning/maintaining/ordering refills for the espresso machine or cold brew keg</li>
                    <li>Cleaning/maintaining/ordering supplies for the pool table, foosball table, or arcade</li>
                    <li>Fixing <a href="https://github.com/chezbob/chezbob/issues">bugs</a> in our infrastructure code</li>
                    <li>Adding new features to our infrastructure code (both serious and <a href="https://github.com/chezbob/chezbob/pull/72">not-so-serious</a> features are encouraged)</li>
                    <li>Anything else you can think of!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're interested in volunteering or have an idea for Chez Bob, please join the #chezbob-volunteers channel in the CSE Slack for more information.</p>

                <h3>Are there any requirements for volunteering?</h3>
                <p>There's no binding commitment or required number of hours to volunteer, we're pretty flexible since we know volunteers are also busy graduate students :). It's totally cool if you need to take a few weeks off of volunteering to work on a paper deadline or attend a conference, for example. If you can't volunteer on a regular basis, you can still help out with one-off tasks (unloading a Costco order, fixing the TV in Chez Bob, etc.) or take part in our quarterly hackathons that we announce in Slack. 

                <h3>I have an idea for contributing to Chez Bob, how can I make it happen?</h3>
                <p>If you have a new idea for Chez Bob, silly or serious, we're totally willing to try it out as long as you're willing to be responsible for it! In the past, students have taken charge of things like ordering specialty snacks/drinks that Costco doesn't carry, setting up collaborations with the Food Recovery Network to deliver more leftover food, upgrading and refurbishing the pool table, and more. Depending on the idea, we can also provide some funding (i.e. like paying to refelt the pool table).</p>

            <h2 id="money">Money</h2>

                <h3>How do I add money to my account?</h3>
                <p>First, log into your account on the kiosk. Then, while logged in, feed cash into the bill acceptor and it will be added to your account. ONLY PUT BILLS INTO THE BILL ACCEPTOR, DON'T PUT ANY COINS :(

                <h3>Can I use a credit card to pay?</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, no. The only way to add money to your account is by putting cash into the kiosk. There are lots of 'fun' fees and regulations associated with adding credit card support, which is why we only do cash.</p>

                <h3>Where does Chez Bob get money?</h3>
                <p>Chez Bob funds itself, and does not receive any payment or funding from the CSE department. Costco orders are paid for with the money made from selling snacks and drinks. This means that it's very important to pay your debts and refrain from stealing, since that leaves Chez Bob with less money to order more snacks and drinks.</p>

            <h2 id="snacks">Snacks</h2>

                <h3>Can you stock this &lt;snack/drink/other item&gt;?</h3>
                <p>Generally yes, with a few caveats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It needs to be stocked by Costco Business (which is not the same as normal Costco! they carry different items)</li>
                    <li>Enough people need to "want" the item, so we can be reasonably sure that everything we order will get sold (you could for example ask in Slack for people to emoji-react if they'd also like this item stocked)</li>
                    <li>If the item doesn't sell, we probably won't order it again (or at least we'll wait a few months before ordering again)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Can you stock this &lt;snack/drink/other item&gt; that Costco Business does not carry?</h3>
                <p>If you want us to stock a specific item that Costco doesn't sell, as long as you are willing to be in charge of ordering it and bringing it into Chez Bob to be stocked, then yes. We can reimburse you directly, usually within a day or two of sending us the receipt. We ask people to order their own special request items to avoid adding on more responsibilities to existing volunteers :).</p>
                
                <h3>Why don't you stock any "healthy" items?</h3>
                <p>We have tried in the past to stack "healthy" items like fruits, vegetables, yogurts, etc., but often these items did not sell quickly enough before they went bad. If there's a lot of support for ordering fresher food, we can try it out again and see if the food gets bought in time.</p> 


            <h2 id="misc">Misc.</h2>

                <h3>What safety measures are in place to safeguard my account?</h3>
                <p>Assuming you have set a password on your account (<a href="#set-pw">instructions to set a password here</a>), your password is hashed and salted before being stored in our database. You can also view the full Chez Bob infrastructure source code <a href="https://github.com/chezbob/chezbob/">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>Can we get this ;&ltboard game;&gt for Chez Bob?</h3>
                <p>Yes, as long as we still have money left in our board game budget! Each academic year, we allocate $100 for buying new board games. Please reach out to us in the #chezbob channel on the CSE Slack, or via email (<a href="mailto:chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu">chezbob@cs.ucsd.edu</a>) to check how much money we have left for the year!</p>
